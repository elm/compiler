# Elm Binary for Windows (x64)

Some people install [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) with `npm`. This package helps make [`npm install elm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm) a bit faster and a bit more reliable. It is not intended for direct use!

If you do not need to use `npm`, the official binaries are published via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases) with installation instructions.
