// enabled. (Enabling this flag globally is a good security measure.)
// Since they won't run the post-install hook, the binaries won't be downloaded
// and installed.
//
// Since this file is included in "bin" in package.json, npm will install
// it automatically in a place that should be on the PATH. All the file does
// is to download the appropriate binary (just like the post-install hook would
// have), replace this file with that binary, and run the binary.
//
// In this way, the first time a user with --ignore-scripts enabled runs this
// binary, it will download and install itself, and then run as normal. From
// then on, it will run as normal without re-downloading.
