# Installing Elm

The normal path is to work through [the guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) until you need to install, but you can skip to installation directly by going [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/terminal.html).

## Installing Multiple Versions

The secret is that Elm is just a single executable file. If you are developing a project in `~/Desktop/project/` you can download this file into that directory and run commands like `~/Desktop/project/elm make src/Main.elm` or `./elm make src/Main.elm`. You just run the local copy of the executable file!

The instructions for [Mac][mac] and [Linux][lin] explain how to do this in more detail. You can follow the same steps on Windows, but you need to do each step by hand. (E.g. download the file through your browser rather than with a terminal command.)

## Installing Previous Versions

The past binaries for Mac, Linux, and Windows are hosted [here](https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases).

You can download the executable files directly and use them locally.
