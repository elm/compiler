# Install Instructions

The easiest way to install is to to use [the Mac installer](https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases/download/0.19.1/installer-for-mac.pkg)!

But it is also possible to install by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Move to your Desktop so you can see what is going on easier.
#
cd ~/Desktop/

# Download the 0.19.1 binary for Linux.
#
# +-----------+----------------------+
# | FLAG      | MEANING              |
# +-----------+----------------------+
# | -L        | follow redirects     |
# | -o elm.gz | name the file elm.gz |
# +-----------+----------------------+
#
curl -L -o elm.gz https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases/download/0.19.1/binary-for-mac-64-bit.gz

# There should now be a file named `elm.gz` on your Desktop.
#
# The downloaded file is compressed to make it faster to download.
# This next command decompresses it, replacing `elm.gz` with `elm`.
#
gunzip elm.gz

# There should now be a file named `elm` on your Desktop!
#
# Every file has "permissions" about whether it can be read, written, or executed.
# So before we use this file, we need to mark this file as executable:
#
chmod +x elm

# The `elm` file is now executable. That means running `~/Desktop/elm --help`
# should work. Saying `./elm --help` works the same.
#
# But we want to be able to say `elm --help` without specifying the full file
# path every time. We can do this by moving the `elm` binary to one of the
# directories listed in your `PATH` environment variable:
#
sudo mv elm /usr/local/bin/

# Now it should be possible to run the `elm` binary just by saying its name!
#
elm --help
```

## What is the `PATH` variable?

When you run a command like `elm make src/Main.elm`, your computer starts by trying to find an executable file called `elm`.

The `PATH` is the list of directories that get searched. You can see these directories by running:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

This prints `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin` on my computer. The directories are separated by a `:` so there are five possibilities listed here.

When I run `elm make src/Main.elm`, my terminal starts by searching these five directories for an executable file named `elm`. It finds `/usr/local/bin/elm` and then runs `/usr/local/bin/elm make src/Main.elm` with whatever arguments I gave.

So the `PATH` environment variable is a convention that allows you to refer to a specific executable file without knowing exactly where it lives on your computer. This is actually how all "terminal commands" work! Commands like `ls` are really executable files that live in directories listed in your `PATH` variable.

So the point of running `sudo mv elm /usr/local/bin/` is to turn the `elm` binary into a terminal command, allowing us to call it just like `ls` and `cd`.

**Note:** Why do we need to use `sudo` for that one command? Imagine if some program was able to add executables named `ls` or `cd` to `/usr/local/bin` that did something tricky and unexpected. That would be a security problem! Many distributions make this scenario less likely by requiring special permissions to modify the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

## Uninstall

The following commands should remove everything:

```bash
# Remove the `elm` executable.
#
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/elm

# Remove any cached files. The files here reduce compile times when
# starting new projects and make it possible to work offline in more
# cases. No need to keep it around if you are uninstalling though!
#
rm -r ~/.elm/
```

If you have any Elm projects still on your computer, you can remove their `elm-stuff/` directories as well.
