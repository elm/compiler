            comment "Thanks for reporting this! To set expectations:

            - Issues are reviewed in [batches](https://github.com/elm/expectations/blob/master/batching.md), so it can take some time to get a response.
            - Ask questions in a [community forum](https://elm-lang.org/community). You will get an answer quicker that way!
            - If you experience something similar, open a new issue. [We like duplicates](https://github.com/elm/expectations/blob/master/duplicates.md).

            Finally, please be patient with the core team. They are trying their best with limited resources."
